Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to apply for the Senior Full Stack Engineer position at **\_\_\_**. With over 14 years of experience in software engineering — spanning backend, frontend, and mobile — I bring a holistic perspective and hands-on expertise in building high-performance, scalable applications.

Most recently at Shopmonkey, I led backend and API development using Node.js and Golang, integrated complex payment systems (Stripe, Finix, First Mile), and built frontend features with Next.js and Tailwind. As the founder of Volandoo, I architected a real-time GPS tracking platform for paragliding — from native mobile apps to backend microservices — now serving 8,000+ users.

I'm passionate about solving problems through code, working with cross-functional teams, and continuously improving both product and process. I'd love the opportunity to bring this mindset and experience to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm happy to share more about my background or discuss how I can contribute to your mission.

Best regards,  
Pedro Enrique
