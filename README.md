# Pedro Enrique – Engineering Resume Hub

👋 Hi, I'm Pedro — a Senior Software Engineer with over 14 years of experience building high-performance applications across mobile, backend, and full stack platforms.

I've worked with companies like Salesforce, Automox, Shopmonkey, and also founded Volandoo — a live tracking and event platform for the paragliding community. I'm passionate about crafting scalable systems, intuitive mobile apps, and reliable user experiences.

This repo contains my most up-to-date resumes and cover letters, tailored for different roles:

-   **Full Stack**: Golang, Node.js, React, Microservices
-   **Mobile**: Native iOS/Android, Swift, Kotlin, Obj-C  
    Each resume highlights relevant projects, experience, and achievements in that domain.
