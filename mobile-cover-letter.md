Hiring Manager,

I’m excited to apply for the Mobile Engineer role at at **\_\_\_**. With over 10 years of experience developing native iOS and Android applications, I’ve led mobile efforts at both startups and large companies, delivering apps used by thousands of users.

At Volandoo, a platform I founded for the paragliding community, I built real-time GPS tracking apps for iOS and Android from scratch — complete with offline handling, custom UI, and live event support. Previously at Salesforce and Appcelerator, I worked on complex enterprise and cross-platform mobile SDKs that supported a wide developer ecosystem.

I bring a user-focused mindset, deep native development skills, and a strong sense of ownership to every project. I’d love the opportunity to bring that same energy to your team.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Pedro Enrique
